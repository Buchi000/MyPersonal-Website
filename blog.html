                The gender gap for programmers is shrinking, but women are still disproportionately stuck in junior positions according to a HackerRank study.

          Women now make up more than half of new computer science graduates and junior developers entering the workforce, according to a study out Thursday from tech recruiting company HackerRank. Women under 25 are also 33 percent more likely to study computer science than those who were born before 1983.
        </p>
        <p>There’s still a visible inequality between the very youngest developers, but it’s nowhere near as wide, with a gap of 1.09x. 84.5 percent of women developers between the ages of 18 and 24 occupy junior roles, compared to 77.3 percent of men</p>
      <p>The report highlights another encouraging trend, and shows that the gap between men and women who learn to code under the age of 16 is narrowing. 13.9 percent of women between the ages of 18 and 24 started coding when they were still in school, compared to 20.9 percent of men in the same age bracket.</p>

        <p class="title">What Is Leadership?</p>
        <article>
          <p>
            The word "leadership" can bring to mind a variety of images.
          </p>
          <p>
            Leaders help themselves and others to do the right things. They set direction, build an inspiring vision, and create something new. Leadership is about mapping out where you need to go to "win" as a team or an organization; and it is dynamic, exciting, and inspiring.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, while leaders set the direction, they must also use management skills to guide their people to the right destination, in a smooth and efficient way.
          </p>

        <h5 class="card-title">According to the idea of transformational leadership , an effective leader is a person who does the following:</h5>
        
        <p class="card-text"><p>1, Creates an inspiring vision of the future.</p>
        <p>2, Motivates and inspires people to engage with that vision.</p>
        <p>3, Manages delivery of the vision.</p>
        <p>4, Coaches and builds a team, so that it is more effective at achieving the vision.</p></p>

      <div id="demo1" class="collapse">
        <h4>1, Creating an Inspiring Vision of the Future</h4>
        <p>In business, a vision is a realistic, convincing and attractive depiction of where you want to be in the future. Vision provides direction, sets priorities, and provides a marker, so that you can tell that you've achieved what you wanted to achieve</p>
        <h4>2, Motivating and Inspiring People</h4>
        <p>A compelling vision provides the foundation for leadership. But it's leaders' ability to motivate and inspire people that helps them deliver that vision.</p>
        <p>For example, when you start a new project, you will probably have lots of enthusiasm for it, so it's often easy to win support for it at the beginning</p>
        <p>Leaders can also motivate and influence people through their natural charisma and appeal, and through other sources of power , such as the power to pay bonuses or assign tasks to people. However, good leaders don't rely too much on these types of power to motivate and inspire others.</p>
      <h4>3, Managing Delivery of the Vision</h4>
    <p>Leaders must ensure that the work needed to deliver the vision is properly managed – either by themselves, or by a dedicated manager or team of managers to whom the leader delegates this responsibility – and they need to ensure that their vision is delivered successfully.</p>
    <h4>4. Coaching and Building a Team to Achieve the Vision</h4>
    <p>Individual and team development are important activities carried out by transformational leaders. To develop a team, leaders must first understand team dynamics.</p>
    <p>Leadership also includes looking for leadership potential  in others. By developing leadership skills within your team, you create an environment where you can continue success in the long term. And that's a true measure of great leadership</p>

      <p class="title"> What is coronavirus?</p>
      <article>
       <p>
  Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that range from the common cold to MERS coronavirus, which is
  Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus and SARs, Severe acute respiratory syndrome
  coronavirus.
  Corona viruses are circulating in animals and some of these coronaviruses have the capability of
  transmitting between animals and humans. We call that a spillover event.</p>
  <p>
  The coronaviruses typically cause respiratory symptoms. So we recommend basic hand hygiene, such
  as washing your hands with soap and water and respiratory hygiene, such as when you sneeze,
  sneezing into your elbow to protect myself from a coronavirus.
  There are Ways to protect yourself  against a potential animal source would be to avoid unnecessary
  unprotected contact with live animals and to make sure that you wash your hands thoroughly after
  contact with animals and also to make sure your meat is cooked thoroughly before consuming.</p>
  <p>
      know ,in Ethiopia the statstcis shows that their are 21 cofirmed cases ,2 recoverd and no death.in usa and italy the death rate is so increasing their is no lucky so our county must protect her citizns by givig awerness about it.
  </p>
  <p>
  There are no specific treatments for coronaviruses, but symptoms can be treated.

      <article>
        <p>
          The United States has been "undiplomatic" in its role facilitating talks between three countries on the Nile River over a giant dam, Ethiopia said on Tuesday, but promised to continue negotiations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Washington has been enabling talks between Ethiopia, Egypt and Sudan to resolve issues over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, set to become the largest hydropower plant in Africa.

                  <p>
                    The US Department of the Treasury (DoT) stepped in last year after Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi put in a request to his ally, US President Donald Trump.
              
              Last week, the DoT said an agreement had been reached and urged Ethiopia to sign "at the earliest possible time", while Egypt said it had signed the "fair and balanced" deal.
              
              However, Ethiopia, which skipped the most recent round of talks, denied any deal had been agreed.
                  </p>
                <p>
                  Ethiopia sees the dam as essential for expanding its electric grid and national development but Egypt, which depends on the Nile for 90 percent of its irrigation and drinking water, sees it as an existential threat.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The statement implied that if Ethiopia starts filling the dam before a deal is reached "it would breach an international legal principle not to cause significant harm to downstream nations", said William Davison, Ethiopia analyst for International Crisis Group, a conflict-prevention organisation.
              
              <p>
              "While Ethiopia disagrees with this and has cause to be concerned, it is not clear if the US has any intention to enforce this position, and it is more likely that negotiations continue in one form or another," Davison said.
