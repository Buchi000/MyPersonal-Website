                The gender gap for programmers is shrinking, but women are still disproportionately stuck in junior positions according to a HackerRank study.

          Women now make up more than half of new computer science graduates and junior developers entering the workforce, according to a study out Thursday from tech recruiting company HackerRank. Women under 25 are also 33 percent more likely to study computer science than those who were born before 1983.
        </p>
        <p>There’s still a visible inequality between the very youngest developers, but it’s nowhere near as wide, with a gap of 1.09x. 84.5 percent of women developers between the ages of 18 and 24 occupy junior roles, compared to 77.3 percent of men</p>
      <p>The report highlights another encouraging trend, and shows that the gap between men and women who learn to code under the age of 16 is narrowing. 13.9 percent of women between the ages of 18 and 24 started coding when they were still in school, compared to 20.9 percent of men in the same age bracket.</p>

        <p class="title">What Is Leadership?</p>
        <article>
          <p>
            The word "leadership" can bring to mind a variety of images.
          </p>
          <p>
            Leaders help themselves and others to do the right things. They set direction, build an inspiring vision, and create something new. Leadership is about mapping out where you need to go to "win" as a team or an organization; and it is dynamic, exciting, and inspiring.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, while leaders set the direction, they must also use management skills to guide their people to the right destination, in a smooth and efficient way.
          </p>
          <p>1, Creates an inspiring vision of the future.</p>
      <p>2, Motivates and inspires people to engage with that vision.</p>
      <p>3, Manages delivery of the vision.</p>
      <p>4, Coaches and builds a team, so that it is more effective at achieving the vision.</p>

    
        <h4>1, Creating an Inspiring Vision of the Future</h4>
        <p>In business, a vision is a realistic, convincing and attractive depiction of where you want to be in the future. Vision provides direction, sets priorities, and provides a marker, so that you can tell that you've achieved what you wanted to achieve</p>
        <h4>2, Motivating and Inspiring People</h4>
        <p>A compelling vision provides the foundation for leadership. But it's leaders' ability to motivate and inspire people that helps them deliver that vision.</p>
        <p>For example, when you start a new project, you will probably have lots of enthusiasm for it, so it's often easy to win support for it at the beginning</p>
        <p>Leaders can also motivate and influence people through their natural charisma and appeal, and through other sources of power , such as the power to pay bonuses or assign tasks to people. However, good leaders don't rely too much on these types of power to motivate and inspire others.</p>
      <h4>3, Managing Delivery of the Vision</h4>
    <p>Leaders must ensure that the work needed to deliver the vision is properly managed – either by themselves, or by a dedicated manager or team of managers to whom the leader delegates this responsibility – and they need to ensure that their vision is delivered successfully.</p>
    <h4>4. Coaching and Building a Team to Achieve the Vision</h4>
    <p>Individual and team development are important activities carried out by transformational leaders. To develop a team, leaders must first understand team dynamics.</p>
    <p>Leadership also includes looking for leadership potential  in others. By developing leadership skills within your team, you create an environment where you can continue success in the long term. And that's a true measure of great leadership</p>

The coronaviruses typically cause respiratory symptoms. So we recommend basic hand hygiene, such
as washing your hands with soap and water and respiratory hygiene, such as when you sneeze,
sneezing into your elbow to protect myself from a coronavirus.
There are Ways to protect yourself  against a potential animal source would be to avoid unnecessary
unprotected contact with live animals and to make sure that you wash your hands thoroughly after
contact with animals and also to make sure your meat is cooked thoroughly before consuming.</p>
