                Women now make up more than half of new computer science graduates and junior developers entering the workforce, according to a study out Thursday from tech recruiting company HackerRank. Women under 25 are also 33 percent more likely to study computer science than those who were born before 1983.
              </p>
              <p>There’s still a visible inequality between the very youngest developers, but it’s nowhere near as wide, with a gap of 1.09x. 84.5 percent of women developers between the ages of 18 and 24 occupy junior roles, compared to 77.3 percent of men</p>
            <p>The report highlights another encouraging trend, and shows that the gap between men and women who learn to code under the age of 16 is narrowing. 13.9 percent of women between the ages of 18 and 24 started coding when they were still in school, compared to 20.9 percent of men in the same age bracket.</p>

                Managing Your Personal Development</p>
                <p>
                  There are a number of steps to take in managing your personal development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    1. Developing a Personal Vision
                    Personal development can simply be for fun. Most of us, however, find it easier to motivate ourselves to learn and improve if we have a purpose in doing so. Developing your personal vision - a clear idea of where you want to be in a few months or years, and why - is a crucial part of developing this purpose.

              <p>
                What is Personal Development?See also: Practical Steps to Personal Development
                
                 
                Personal development is a lifelong process. It is a way for people to assess their skills and qualities, consider their aims in life and set goals in order to realise and maximise their potential.
                
                This page helps you to identify the skills you need to set life goals which can enhance your employability prospects, raise your confidence, and lead to a more fulfilling, higher quality life. Plan to make relevant, positive and effective life choices and decisions for your future to enable personal empowerment.
                
                Although early life development and early formative experiences within the family, at school, etc. can help to shape us as adults, personal development should not stop later in life.
                
                This page contains information and advice that is designed to help you to think about your personal development and ways in which you can work towards goals and your full potential.
                
                ‘Personal Development’ and ‘Personal Empowerment’ are two areas that overlap and interweave, so it is recommended that you read this page in conjunction with our page on Personal Empowerment.
                
                Why is Personal Development Important?
                There are many ideas surrounding personal development, one of which is Abraham Maslow's process of self-actualisation.
                
                Self-Actualisation
                Maslow (1970) suggests that all individuals have an in-built need for personal development which occurs through a process called self-actualisation.
                
                The extent to which people are able to develop depends on certain needs being met and these needs form a hierarchy.  Only when one level of need is satisfied can a higher one be developed.  As change occurs throughout life, however, the level of need motivating someone’s behaviour at any one time will also change.
                
                Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. Physiological Needs, Safety Needs, Love and Belongingness, Esteem Needs, Cognitive Needs, Aesthetic Needs and Self-Actualisation.
                At the bottom of the hierarchy are the basic physiological needs for food, drink, sex and sleep, i.e., the basics for survival.
                Second are the needs for safety and security in both the physical and economic sense.
                Thirdly, progression can be made to satisfying the need for love and belonging.
                The fourth level refers to meeting the need for self-esteem and self-worth. This is the level most closely related to ‘self-empowerment’.
                The fifth level relates to the need to understand. This level includes more abstract ideas such as curiosity and the search for meaning or purpose and a deeper understanding.
                The sixth relates to aesthetic needs of beauty, symmetry and order.
                Finally, at the top of Maslow’s hierarchy is the need for self-actualisation.
                Maslow (1970, p.383) says that all individuals have the need to see themselves as competent and autonomous, also that every person has limitless room for growth.
                
                Self-actualisation refers to the desire that everybody has ‘to become everything that they are capable of becoming’. In other words, it refers to self-fulfilment and the need to reach full potential as a unique human being.
                
                For Maslow, the path to self-actualisation involves being in touch with your feelings, experiencing life fully and with total concentration.

                Managing Your Personal Development
                There are a number of steps to take in managing your personal development.
                
                1. Developing a Personal Vision
                Personal development can simply be for fun. Most of us, however, find it easier to motivate ourselves to learn and improve if we have a purpose in doing so. Developing your personal vision - a clear idea of where you want to be in a few months or years, and why - is a crucial part of developing this purpose.
                
                There is more about this in our pages on Developing a Personal Vision, Refining and Narrowing Your Vision, and Setting Personal Goals.
                2. Planning Your Personal Development
                Once you are clear about where you want to be, you can start planning how to get there. Drawing up a personal development plan is not essential, but it does make the planning process more realistic</p>
