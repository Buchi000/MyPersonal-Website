                            <p>Hi,my name is Mekides Getahun and I am 20 years old.I am studying soft ware engineering at Addis Ababa University in center of information technology.
                                To be honest, I might have learned more than what a typical 20-year-old girl would be able to.for example When I was a kid, I thought that everyone would be with me until the end. As I grew older, things changed. Many left the endless journey, for different reasons.</p>

                    I cannot imagine living my life without my family by my side. Family is very important and valuable to me and is something that should never be taken for granted. Without my family, a large part of my life and culture would be missing and in my opinion a it is made up of people who we can trust

                <p>
                    my father is a teacher and my mother is house wief. In spite of the fact that my parents were working a lot, they always tried to find enough time to devote for me and for my two siisters and brother
    My parents gave me a lot of essential knowledge and lessons that I will remember all my life. My father taught me to be fearless and independent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was taking example of while trying to be a good person. They taught me to care about the others. I was helping my little brother with his homework .
    I have two sisters and 1 brother
    We were growing in the atmosphere of love . I was the second child for five years, and then my little sister came along. seven years after redi was born, my brother zekarias was born; I was 12 years old then. There is quite an age gap between my siblings and I which is tremendous and bad at the same time.
