                            <p>Hi,my name is Mekides Getahun and I am 20 years old.I am studying soft ware engineering at Addis Ababa University in center of information technology.
                                To be honest, I might have learned more than what a typical 20-year-old girl would be able to.for example When I was a kid, I thought that everyone would be with me until the end. As I grew older, things changed. Many left the endless journey, for different reasons.</p>

                            <p>My educational history brgans in the Kindergarten Akiya,and continued for 3 years.that was the best time ever. i had a lot of friends.my greads were very good i got many distiniction card was continued almost for 11 years or up to 8th grade.
                                when i was 15 i joined Lideta Catholic Cathedral highschool by takign an intrance exam the entrance exam was not difficult the problem is that communication with other students because i am not good at that but my work load increases.
                                currently I am studying software engineering at Addis Ababa Univeristy. the course is a bit challenging since we are given loads of assignments and projects. but i am coping with it since i am a type of person that love to cope with problem solving and the department i joined is inline with my interest.</p>
